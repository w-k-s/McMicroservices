## TO-DO

- [ ] Use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66352547/embedded-kafka-test-the-kafka-listener-is-not-invoked) example and try to see if you can consume objects rather than consuming strings and then serialzing them into objects.
- [ ] Need to understand more about what the difference is between the group_in application.properties vs the one set in `@KafkaListener```
